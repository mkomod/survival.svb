Description: Variable selection in a high dimensional setting is 
    becoming a task of key importance, particularly in the biomedical 
    sciences where data is often high-dimensional. This package 
    implements methodology designed to performs variable selection in 
    a high-dimensional settings, whilst also providing mechanisms for 
    uncertainty quantification and effect estimations. Broadly, we 
    use a spike-and-slab prior with Laplace slab and Dirac spike and 
    seek to approximate the corresponding posterior using variational 
    inference. Our variational approximation thereby provides posterior 
    inclusion probabilities, point estimates for the effect sizes and
    uncertainty quantification for the effect sizes.
